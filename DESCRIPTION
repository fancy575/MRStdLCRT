Description: Provides estimation and leave-one-cluster-out jackknife standard errors
    for four longitudinal cluster-randomized trial estimands: horizontal individual
    average treatment effect (h-iATE), horizontal cluster average treatment effect
    (h-cATE), vertical individual average treatment effect (v-iATE), and vertical
    cluster-period average treatment effect (v-cATE), using unadjusted and augmented
    (model-robust standardization) estimators. The working model may be fit using
    linear mixed models for continuous outcomes or generalized estimating equations
    and generalized linear mixed models for binary outcomes. Period inclusion for
    aggregation is determined automatically: only periods with both treated and
    control clusters are included in the construction of the marginal means and
    treatment effect contrasts. See Fang et al. (2025) <arXiv:2507.17190>
